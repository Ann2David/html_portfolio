<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
     Hi, my name is David Ann and I am a student of the University Of Port Harcourt, Nigeria. I'm currently in my final year; I am studying Human Kinetics at the University. 
The school is great, the people are fantastic and the atmosphere is one that makes you actually want to go to school. I was born and raised in Abuja but later moved to 
Port harcourt Rivers state to further my education.

     am an interesting, fun loving girl with a good sense of humor. I love to code and I'm a bit athletic, I come of as a very shy person, well not all the timee but once
I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. I'm not a peoples person, so  I dont really have to many friends. and I am all different.
I joke, laugh and humor people.I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. 
I am also a very straight and honest person. and above all, I'm a Christian. I believe in God.
